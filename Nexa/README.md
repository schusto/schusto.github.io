# Random Broadlink RM Code Generator And Utils

Every time i want to buy some new smart component for my smart home, i need a remote, just to have
some random RF code for the component. why should i buy a remote that i use only once just to learn the code?
why cant i just generate some random one?

So I Looked at the net for a long time and did not find any generator for RF codes. so i just created one.
